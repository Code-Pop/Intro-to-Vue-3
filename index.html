      <p>{{ description}}</p>
      <!-- all this done, start liveServer or use http://localhost:5500 => Socks is getting displayed!!-->
    </div>

    <!-- Import VueApp -->
    <script src="./main.js"></script>
    
    <!-- Mount App -->
    <script>
      // refers to the app we just imported via main.js
      const mountedApp = app.mount('#app')
      // #app = argument that is a DOM selector used to plug the app into a piece of our DOM (id="app" at line 13)


      // explanation of how this is working:
      // when we created our Vue app, we said const app = Vue.createApp({}),
      // then we passed in the options object. This allows us to add some optional properties in order
      // to configure our application. 
      // and even though its called an options object, its NOT OPTIONAL! 
      // you always gonna have to pass in at least an empty object to get it started.
      //
      // doing this creates our Vue Instance which is the heart of our Vue application which powers everything.
      // on that options object we added our data option, data() {}
      // which returned an object full of our data, return { product: 'Socks'}
      // as of now, its just product whose value is Socks.
      //
      // we then imported our app into our HTML file
      // div id="app"
      // h1 {{ product }}
      // and then mounted it into the DOM, const mountedApp = app.mount('#app')
      // which effectively plugged our app into that div container with the id of app.
      // !! now at this point, that div and everything within it has access to our Vue app !!
      // so we´re able to ask the app 'hey, whats the value of product?'
      // and the app responds => Socks
      // so when the page renders, we see socks display on the page
      //
      // the {{ }} allow us to run valid JavaScript within our HTML
      // so we could do things like concatenating strings  {{ firstName + '' + lastName }}
      // running conditional logic with the ternary operator {{ clicked ? true : false }}
      // running message on our data and much more {{ message.method() }}

      // if we change Socks to Boots in the main.js, the DOM would update to Boots
      // how is that happening?
      // Vue is reactive!!
      // under the hood Vue has an entire reactivity center that handles updating
      // so when a data value changes, anything relaying on that data value is gonna automatically update for us.
      // we don´t have to do anything to make that happen.
      // reactivity is covered in advanced course
      // 
      // if we´re using {{ product }} in multiple places within our template, and product were to update,
      // every place that was using that value is gonna update, all thanks to Vue´s reactivity system
      //
      // in browser console type: mountedApp.product = 'Shoes'
      // the DOM is gonna update automatically

      // first challenge:
      // add a data description to the data object, then display that description using an expression within a <p> tag
